It is\015\012shown how the sun-synchronous and high-inclination high-eccentricity\015\012frozen orbits for communication in high-latitude countries arise from\015\012the nonspherical gravity perturbations. The Sun and the Moon orbital\015\012perturbations of geostationary satellites such as INSAT (Indian\015\012Communication Satellites) are formulated, stationkeeping strategies are\015\012devised, and the attendant fuel consumption over the lifetime of the\015\012satellite is estimated.\015\012Section 3 presents radar, laser, and the Global Positioning System\015\012(GPS) satellite tracking systems and their observation models. Groundbased\015\012radar measurement models of pointing angles, slant range, and\015\012range rate are developed. Doppler and GPS pseudorange measurements\015\012are formulated. Tropospheric and ionospheric media corrections are\015\012analyzed. For statistical determination of orbits from the\015\012measurements, the trajectory and measurement models are linearized\015\012and the extended Kalman filter formulation is developed. Three\015\012practical applications of the statistical model concerned with Indian\015\012satellites are presented: orbit determination error analysis of tracking\015\012system for geostationary communication satellites (INSATs); real-time\015\012orbit determination of low-altitude Indian Remote Sensing Satellites\015\012(IRSs) with GPS receivers; IRS orbit determination with an IRNSS\015\012geostationary satellite acting as a relay.\015\012Matlab and C++ codes will be used to illustrate the course material.\015\012

This\015\012uncertainty is in the form of uncertainty (noise) in measurements as well\015\012as disturbances/noise in the process. The theory covered will deal with\015\012estimation for dynamic systems for both linear and nonlinear processes, as\015\012well as for gaussian and non-gaussian noise characteristics. Issues\015\012related to constraints on process states (constrained estimation), and\015\012delayed and multirate measurements will also be dealt with. It is expected\015\012that this course will expose the student to not only the well-accepted\015\012basics of estimation, but also to recent advances in this area. Throughout\015\012the course, the main ideas will be illustrated using matlab-based\015\012examples. The following topics will be covered: (i) Linear Optimal\015\012(Kalman) Filtering: Least squares formulation, Stochastic formulation,\015\012Riccatti equation and solution techniques, Sensitivity and sub-optimal\015\012filtering, Smoothing. (ii) Nonlinear Filtering with Gaussian Noise:\015\012Extended Kalman filtering, Unscented Kalman filtering. (iii) Particle\015\012Filtering: Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) methods, Markov processes, SMC\015\012based particle filtering, Resampling-MOVE algorithm, Importance sampling,\015\012SMC based smoothing, Self organizing state space models, Regularization in\015\012particle filtering. (iv) Miscellaneous Topics: Deterministic linear and\015\012nonlinear observers, Combined parameter and state estimation, Constrained\015\012moving horizon estimators, Incorporation of delayed and multirate\015\012measurements.\015\012\015\012	2009-07-21 10:15:24.577617

The biological database are of many different kinds and more and more are emerging with the advent of the technology in the respective field.  Although the differnt databases are related to each other, the link is not always clear.  The challenge lies in understanding the link between these databases to glean new biological information.  Another avenbue is to apply systems science approach to understand biology better. The course introduces students to biological databases, inter-and intra-database relationships, various algorithms, verbal models, quantitative models, etc. The course would cater to both biologist as well as non-biologists.	2005-06-21 16:13:31

CL 724	Technology Design and Development Laboratory	6	L 	0	4	1	0	N	""	NA	The basic components of the course are:1. Lectures/Tutorials: Fundamentals of  need, innovation, technology, design, development and deployment  - to be covered in about 8 lectures  (4 in Jan and 4 in Feb) in the first two months semester.  2. Laboratory: Manufacturing machine/equipment training, hands on practice on the machines - to be covered in 8 lab sessions (4 in Jan and 4 in Feb). Students, who seek to practice further, will have access to extra practice sessions in the first two months of the semester.  The students will get trained to use the fabrication machines and develop basic skills so that they should be adequately abled. 3. Mini project: identified by a group of students (likely 3) based on need assessment and on arriving at a clearly defined problem statement. Project work is expected to include definition of the problem - scope of work -  a plan to meet  problem objective(s) - production of a working unit - testing, demonstration and assessment of its performance - preparation and presentation of a report and a business plan.  The project has to be completed in two months, preferably using resources available in the Chemical Engineering workshop, the Tata Centre Lab, or other labs on campus. A letter from Tata Centre extending the facilities has been provided. Students are expected to complete projects on their own. In exceptional cases where facilities or prototyping skills are not available on campus, project can be outsourced on consultation with the course instructors.	2014-11-25 15:46:53.265517

The course will be    structured around lectures, exercises and    assignments. Every topic will be introduced    before its corresponding hands-on component.    The idea is to learn and explore a full-fledged    operating system up-close and to use it for    kernel-based modifications. Observing and    manipulating a real operating system is a key    feature of the course. The exercises, meant to    get an inside view of the kernel, will lead up to a    project that will have to be submitted as the final    submission for the course.    The course will consist of 3 hours of class    meetings/lectures per week.    As part of the course students will be expected    to,    - report progress and participate in weekly class    meetings,    - submit/update-on wiki notes about weeklyreadings and assignments,- do exercises to supplement readings,- the kernel know-how will be based on lectures,book-readings and implementation-basedexercises- implement a project that involves non-trivialcode changes to the kernelList of topics that will be covered:- Kernel compilation and modules- System calls and in-line assembly- Memory addressing and page tables- Process management and scheduling- Interrupts and interrupt handlers- Kernel timers and synchronization- The virtual file system interface- Kernel tracing, probing and profiling tools	2015-01-19 10:53:38.977162

This course will aim to introduce,\015\012identify and explore  the research avenues and implementation issues related to Cloud-based\015\012systems.\015\012 Specifically, the course will involve two parts---(i) extensive paper\015\012reading and some lectures for in-class discussions and (ii) a significant hands-on implementation project.\015\012\015\012 From a background perspective there are several facets to cloud\015\012 computing systems---\015\012 instantiation options, virtualization technologies, overheads of virtualization, server consolidation and capacity planning, dynamic resource provisioning,\015\012migration and dynamic placement techniques, power-aware provisioning etc. Most ofthis material will be covered and studied using readings based on published papers and in some cases  from books. \015\012The instructor will introduce a topic and student/instructor talk on the topic will follow. Each topic will be an in-class discussion and will require student inputs (in terms of class participation and submission of reviews etc.).\015\012>\015\012The hands-on component of the course, aims to expose students to several implementation issues via exercises and a project. Software components\015\012of clouds  include several Virtualization technologies, on-line cloud providers,  cloud resource\015\012> management software and cloud simulators. In the first half of the class students will try-\015\012out a subset of these options as warm-up exercises to understand  deployment and usage related issues. The second half of the course, will involve\015\012using a subset of these software resources for project involving some problem-solving and\015\012experimenting components.\015\012>\015\012> The combination of paper readings for background and research topics and implementing and testing a solution, will provide an in-depth view of the issues on the  areas of Cloud Computing.\015\012>\015\012> A list of potential topics that will covered:\015\012> \302\225 Overview of Virtualization/Cloud Computing\015\012> \302\225 Virtualization Technologies and Architectures\015\012> \302\225 Measurement and Profiling of Virtualized-Applications\015\012> \302\225 Server Consolidation and Placement Policies\015\012> \302\225 Dynamic Provisioning and Resource Management\015\012> \302\225 Migration Mechanisms\015\012> \302\225 Power management in Virtualized Environments\015\012> \302\225 Implications of Resource Affinity and Interference\015\012> \302\225 Implementation Examples of Cloud Services\015\012\015\012	2011-01-03 16:48:36.726887

The course\015\012begins with a primer on optical communication that enables the student to\015\012understand optical transmission. The course then delves into the\015\012networking aspects of optical networks, in particular focusing on\015\012paradigms of lightpaths and eventually leading to emerging paradigms of\015\012RPR and light-trails. Effort will be focused on contemporary optical\015\012network architectures, technologies, node architecture and protocols. In\015\012particular, focus will be on analysis and design of emerging optical\015\012platforms and networks. Recent developments like RPR would be understood\015\012and open problems discussed. In the last few weeks of the course, the\015\012focus shifts from optical networks to access networks by delving on\015\012service oriented networking. Part of this effort includes emerging revenue\015\012bearing services like IPTV, Triple Play, PWE3 etc. Access networking\015\012technologies that interface with optical networks would also be studied.\015\012Technologies such as WiFi and WiMax would be covered in the course from\015\012and end-to-end  dsign point of view.\015\012	2003-04-03 16:18:14

This course aims to bring together Shakespearean texts and their more famous reinventions in the twentieth century and after. Select Shakespearean texts will be read alongside their later reinventions for comparative analysis, as well as an understanding of how themes and techniques come to be modified and re-envisioned, across genres and media, like the graphic novel and film. How does a pre-eminently visual medium such as Neil Gaiman302222s graphic-novel version of A Midsummer Night302222s Dream speak to a play, whose language was seen as a competent substitute for any visual accessories including stage props? How, to what extent and towards what intent do Shakespearean rewritings exploit the formulaic nature of his plays? What interpretative dimension has technology added to reinventions?

New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1993\015\012	The course attempts to introduce students to the ideas that have shaped modern India. It contends that our present is shaped as much (or perhaps more) by the philosophical, political and cultural thought and debates in twentieth century India as those from an earlier period. The contemporary-ness of thinking from this part of the world is often understood in terms of a derivative or at worst a mimicry of western thought. This approach limits our entry points into understanding the complex nature of our present and freezes thought in a pre-colonial time. Thinking in India becomes \302\221Indian thought\302\222 \302\226 India as a geographical given and \302\221Indian\302\222 as frozen in time and unchanged.\015\012\015\012The course, through detailed study of the works of three \302\221thinkers\302\222 in twentieth century India, attempts to think through our present. The idea of a thinker as far as the course is concerned will be extended to individuals who intervened in the present as political thinkers, philosophers, artists and so on. In a given instance, the course will take up three thinkers whose work has been influential in different fields for discussion. Thus it will try present as diverse philosophical traditions, political spectrum and aesthetic locations. The contexts within which thinkers are produced will also be taken up for discussion. \015\012\015\012The pool of thinkers from which selections will be made will include but will not be limited to Amrita Sher-gill, Anand Patwardhan, Arundhati Roy, Bama, Bhupen Kakkar, BR Ambedkar, EMS Nambudiripad, Guru Dutt, Ismat Chugtai, Jawaharlal Nehru, Kamala Das, Kancha Illiah, Mahasweta Devi, MK Gandhi, Namdeo Dhasal, N Pushpamala, Pandita Ramabai, Periyaar Ramaswamy Naicker, Premchand, Rabindranath Tagore, Raj Kapoor, Ritwik Ghatak, Sadat Hassan Manto, Safdar Hashmi, Saroj Pathak, Satyajit Ray, Tarabai Shinde, UR Ananthmurthy, Vaikom Muhammed Basheer and VD Savarkar. \015\012

Even when focusing on one or a few authors, the course might include other authors to situate the author under study, to compare, or to further our understanding of the genre, style, themes, contexts, or issues relevant to his or her writing. The course may also include writings/writers in English translation.\015\012\015\012Partition of the subcontinent in 1947, Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971, and return of Partition-like violence in more recent times in this geographical region might form some of the immediate contexts of the author/authors under examination. In their texts, this course will seek to foreground, on the one hand, the interplay of history, identity, social movements, collective violence, and social suffering, and, on the other, the role of fiction in making sense of these categories as well as fiction as documentation.\015\012\015\012At the very basic level, the course aims to teach students ways of reading literature and literary criticism: students are expected to learn how to situate authors and literary texts to social, historical, and political contexts, how to analyze fiction, and how to write about them. Along with gaining knowledge and insight into the selected author or authors, students will also be invited to appreciate the complexities of the themes and issues they will locate in the literary texts they will study. \015\012Authors may include, but are not limited to, the following: Anita Desai, Amitav Ghosh, Sorayya Khan, Jhumpa Lahiri, Saadat Hasan Manto, Rohinton Mistry, Michael Ondaatje, Nayantara Sahgal, Kamila Shamsie, Bapsi Sidhwa, M.G.

These   efforts   are    based primarily  on  empirical studies  of  various categories of successful Indian  enterprises.  This  course attempts to analyze  the  Indian organization today.  It also studies how  the values  of  the Indian  manager  affects  his performance.   Emphasis on individual  values would be given, as organisational values stem from individual values.

HS 625	Philosophy of Education	6	T 	3	0	0	0	N	0	""	Education is about learning. Learning is an important aspect of life. Every living being learns to survive. As Charles Darwin hypothesized about the existence of various species in the world that a living being struggles to exist. And whoever is biologically fit will exists otherwise would perish from the world. Following this Karl Popper, one of the eminent philosophers of science advocates evolutionary epistemology. Learning defined in the theoretical framework of evolutionary epistemology shows the knowledge acquisition happens due to certain biological disposition. The biological need of life explains the necessity of knowledge. Learning therefore remains a continuous activity. One continues to learn in order to remain in the world. So the notion of survival or enduring life goes along with seeking information and bringing change in accord with the information of one\302\222s own well being. The enduring life here refers to an active life where the being participates in the world for its well being. Human life is such that the act of knowledge seeking, which Aristotle defines as the desire to know is something very primitive. It is not merely part of human biological history but also significant for understanding the cultural history. The biological history of human life is significant as it has helped us developing our food habits and medicine. The cultural history tells us understanding the development of values in general and institutions and institutional values in particular.  The development of culture is significant because human life is not merely confined to certain biological activities. Rather human life transcends the limit of biological existence. This transcendence is embedded in the very attitude of knowledge seeking \302\226 learning. Learning pervades both the biological forms of life as well as the cultural forms of life. Interestingly the well being of human life requires both that is the biological fitness and the cultural elegance.  \015\012In this course, we study philosophical ideas of Plato, Aristotle, Jacque Rousseau, John Dewey, Maria Montessori, Nel Nodding, Paulo Freire, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Sri Aurobindo and Jiddu Krishnamurthi. The teaching will be related to some of the contemporary issues related to education and society. \015\012\015\012\015\012	2015-01-05 14:25:35.20614

The course will look closely at one of the central markers of contemporary India - the question of\015\012caste. Two objectives drive this course. One: the world of academia has repeatedly, and more\015\012constitutively so in the last two decades, failed to preserve a distinct space for itself in public debates\015\012on caste. It is afflicted irrevocably by articulations, resistances, protests, governmentalisation that\015\012ostensibly lie outside the \302\221objective\302\222 academic world. The guiding motive of this course is to reflect\015\012upon this muddling up. Two: sociology in/of India has frequently alternated between centralising\015\012and marginalising caste in its endeavours to understand contemporary India. This course will enable\015\012students in tracking the trajectory of this ambiguity and its meanings and functions.\015\012The course is divided into three segments.\015\012a) Strands of the early caste debate: A view from nowhere?\015\012The scholarly literature on caste is defiantly but excitingly variegated. This segment will try to\015\012make a summative sense of the early scholarship, to get a flavour of the different perspectives,\015\012divergent inflections and the very many controversies.\015\012b) `Governing Caste?`: Caste, State, Politics and the Judiciary\015\012This segment focuses on questions of governance in relation to caste. The increasing visibility\015\012that caste has acquired in the last century or so vis-\303\240-vis aspects of democracy, assertion,\015\012representation, and community access to modern resources have invariably brought in structures\015\012and discourses of the state into interrogation. This segment familiarises students with the body of\015\012works dealing with this theme.\015\012c) The State of the Caste Question\015\012This final segment will further the `muddling up` of the caste question that the previous section\015\012presented. But here the focus is decidedly on the very present - that is to say, on the last two\015\012decades and the interesting questions this period has thrown up. It will cover questions of\015\012secularisation of caste, caste through the lens of gender and `ethnicity`, co-existence of internal\015\012differentiation and aggregation from afar etc.	2010-01-05 10:11:34.894193

Yet there are profound differences in the larger cultural context for ethical decision-making.  As international collaborations become more common, new generations of scholars enter the field of research, and norms and consequences of research become more complicated, these differences need to be more fully confronted.  Standard guidelines on responsible conduct of research or IPR / Copyright rules tend to ignore cross-cultural challenges of ethical decision-making in the scientific endeavor, and also ignore alternate perspectives and approaches to such issues.  Moving away from norms that are largely proscriptive, field- and country-specific, and from guidelines and approaches to ethical issues that are universalizing, or based on fundamentally western notions of individual intellectual property rights rather than collaborative values, this course places emphasis upon cultural context and upon partnership with international scholars and diverse community groups in developing a new kind of training in scholarly integrity. Through discussing a range of topics from science and engineering especially related to issues of development and change, the course aims to develop skills related to decisions making in the scientific endeavour \302\226 from issues of methodology and development paradigms, to issues of responsibility, informed consent, intellectual property rights, commons, natural resources, livelihoods, sustainability, participation, and scientific and engineering ethics codes. Case studies from real life will be used as tools for class room based workshops on ethical decision making in different scientific arenas. Contentious issues from areas such as biotechnology, civil engineering, water resources management, IPRs/creative commons, and environmental risks will form the core of issues around which teaching will be organized.\015\012\015\012Topics to be covered1.

Beginning with the works of Franz Brentano (act psychology) and Wilhelm Dilthey (human science) the course would explore the \015\012phenomenological, existential, and post-structural aspects of the psychoanalytical works of Kierkegaard, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Marcel, Levinas, Bachelard, Buytenkijk, Lacan , Schutz, Derrida  and Foucault. Some of the psychoanalysts whose works are to be studied include Binswanger, Boss, Straus, van den Berg, Laing, von Gebasattel, Minkowski, Frankl, May, and Van Kaam. The topics covered would be phenomenological reductions and methods, intentionality, the life world, intersubjectivity, Dasein, Difference, Dissemination, the hermeneutic circle, spatiality, sociality, temporality, freedom, the body-subject, pracktognosia, praxis and process, and metabletics. Psychological topics may include perception, emotion, imagination, behavior, development, language, thought, relations with others, the surrounding environment, physiology, dreams, family structure, the self, and psychopathology. Some attention would also be devoted to the practice of assessment and therapy.\015\012	2003-12-12 15:21:58

New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2002.	This is an advanced course on Postcolonial Theory. In this course, we will examine some of the influential scholarship that constitutes the field of Postcolonial Studies. We will look at a few of the important debates that were waged, including a fierce one on the legitimacy of the term 302221postcolonial302222 itself, the critical vocabulary and methodological tools that developed, and analytical practices that this field engendered. Some of the topics that the course may wish to emphasize upon are as follows: 1) colonial discourse analysis, which forms a significant part of Postcolonial Studies, especially in the formative years. 2) The institutional and disciplinary history of the development of Postcolonial Studies: how it was and is conditioned by it development in the Anglo-American academy, specifically in English departments, since the1980s. 3) Postcolonial Studies302222 relationship with other parallel fields302227 such as Cultural Studies, Feminism and Queer Studies,  Memory and Trauma Studies, and so on302227which have overlapping, and sometimes conflicting, concerns with Postcolonial Studies. 4) New directions and future of Postcolonial Studies.In selecting texts and debates from what is a robust field, we may show a bias for those that pertain to the Indian subcontinent. While reference to literary studies and literary texts will assume importance in our endeavour, this course is not intended to be a literature survey course. 	2013-01-09 15:01:52.483783

The course will introduce some basic theoretical elements of HCI such as Garrett\302\222s layers of user experience, human cognitive processes such as memory, affordances, mappings, conceptual models and heuristics and principles of good design. The course will try to communicate that there are bad designs everywhere \302\226 why interaction designers go wrong. It will then provide an introduction to the HCI design process, including how to understand users through contextual interviews, how to analyse interviews to identify problems and opportunities, how to define usability goals and user experience goals, how to model users with techniques such as stages of use model and personas, how to explore solutions through scenarios, how to prototype explorations and how to evaluate prototypes for usability. Depending on the interest of the students, the course may cover some related topics such as user experience metrics, integrating HCI in software development and HCI in India.	2011-06-06 12:12:41.282588

Using human information processing capabilities, the course looks back towards formal concepts such as visual complexity, visual interest and recall of forms. The first part covers topics such as spatio-temporal relationships in visual elements and its role in visual structure, forms of visual relationships, and its role in controlling visual complexity, interest and identity. Assignments are also based on application of Information theory to visual information. The second part discusses the role of characteristic features in object/form recognition and natural categorization process. Concepts of prototypicality and variations are discussed through assignments. 	2010-07-13 16:45:44.139947

The course will take up a few of these to explore modeling, computation and IT-enabled implementation of solutions in some areas of Supply Chain Management. The application areas include material flow management across the supply chain, value management and analysis of total supply chain costs, robust design of supply chains, co-ordination of supply chain decisions and handling of uncertainties in supply chain management. The emphasis will be on modeling, analysis and implementation issues, including a few case studies, but the relevant techniques will be covered as required.	2006-03-20 16:49:50

Young, Strategic Learning and Its Limits, Oxford, 2004.\015\012	Noncooperative game theory focusses on equilibrium in games, especially Nash equilibrium and its\015\012refinements. It does not inform us when and why we might expect that the observed play in a game\015\012will correspond to one of these equilibria. In this course, we study these aspects. When a game is\015\012played again and again, equilibrium arises as the long-run outcome of a process. In this process,\015\012the players involved may not be fully rational. Thus this course aims to study various dynamic\015\012mechanisms whose long-run behavior converges to the equilibrium.

B.: The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition, Longman; 4th edition (1999).\015\012	The aim of this course is to help a doctoral student effectively communicate her/his (mathematical) ideas to an audience. There are two main components of this course; written communication and verbal communication.\015\012\015\012For the written part, the student will learn a typesetting language, like LaTex, and demonstrate her/his skills by preparing a written report on a topic of her/his own choice. Out of the six main areas represented in the department, the student will choose an area. Then the student will choose a topic in this area of current interest in consultation with a faculty. The student will then find recent articles on the topic using internet resources like MathSciNet, Google Scholar, etc. and the library. The student is expected to write a summary of these articles and prepare a report. Learning LaTex, choice of a topic and finding relevant material on the internet should be completed by the mid-semester examination. After that the student will write the report in not more than three weeks time. It is important that a student does not plagiarise while writing this report. This should be informed by the instructor to all the students at the beginning of the course. \015\012\015\012For the verbal part, the student will choose another area represented in the department, different from the one chosen for the written part. In this area, the student will choose a  topic of general interest and will give a presentation of up to two hours on the chosen topic. After the mid-semester examination is over, the student will start thinking about the topic for verbal presentation, prepare the presentation in about three-four weeks and deliver it in the last two weeks of the semester.\015\012As an example, if a student chooses the topic of differential equations for her written communication project, a possible choice of topic may be the Navier-Stokes equations (in dimension 2 perhaps) and she will write a report stating the interest in the equations due to their describing various physical phenomena, a bit of history and recent results proving the existence and smoothness of the solutions. \015\012If, for the verbal part, the student now chooses functional analysis, she may choose the celebrated Gelfand-Naimark theorem (perhaps for commutative C*-algebras) and give two lectures on it. She need not prepare a written report for this presentation.

They will be located either with a local NGO or a local Govt office.  The students will be required o make social observations and keep records in a diary.  The objective is to familiarize with a rural setting as planners for a region or a public utility project.  The students will make observations on resource-technology-need linkages (forward and backward) and learn to incorporate them in an in-house system dynamics model to assess impacts of different technological interventions on future sustainability of regions.  They will be required to defend the best-practise scenario generated by them using the model.	2012-07-11 16:37:19.320581

TD 691	Development Protocols	6	S 	1	0	0	0	N	""	Handouts as per the requirement	A development protocol is a key step in the study, analysis and solution of a development problem.  It is a fixed sequence of steps and procedures and with an expected set of outcomes.  This course is aimed at exposing students to specific protocols in the water, energy, environment and agriculture sector using both policy analysis and field methods. The course will require students to carry out one of the protocols and practices already developed in CTARA and to report the outcomes. Examples of such protocols are:\015\012(i)Analysis of a piped water supply scheme: This protocol will analyze an existing water supply scheme. The aspects covered will be technical, socio-economic and institutional, such as demand and supply, source and strength of source, simulations of systems, study of pani-samiti and so on.  It will involve meeting with all stakeholders, such as beneficiary villages, elected representatives, department engineers etc., and building a document analyzing the scheme as per existing protocols.\015\012(ii)Analysis of a jaggery plant: This protocol will analyze the working of an existing jaggery plant. It will measure the technical a well as the socio-economic parameters of the plant. This includes thermal efficiency, feed-stock, packaging, bagasse re-use, operations and so on.\015\012The course will begin with training the student in the methodology and tools required to execute the protocol. This may be, e.g., instrumentation, simulation, questionnaire development, documentation etc. This will be followed by the protocol itself. Finally, the outcome of the protocol will be documented and reported in a suggested format to all stakeholders.  Evaluation of the student will be based on the reporting and analysis of using the protocol. The student must submit a report and make a presentation.

Students will also explore and investigate relationship between narrative and narrative devices where the device or crafted object becomes an embodiment of the story, both transcending and retaining its own materiality. Through group and individual projects students will document and /or analyze such traditions that bring together narrative and 2D/3D visual devices within the framework of existing theories on Narrative and Indian Narratology.\015\012Categories of Indian Narratives\015\012Narrative Models\015\012Narrative Structures (Indian and Western)\015\012Time and Space in Narrative\015\012Verbal and Visual Narratives\015\012Modes of Visual Narrative\015\012Visual Devices and changing technology\015\012Folklore traditions\015\012Methods of documentation and analysis

"\302\223Seeing establishes our place in the surrounding world;\015\012we explain that world with words, but words can never\015\012undo the fact that we are surrounded by it. The relation\015\012between what we see and what we know is never\015\012settled.\302\224\015\012Ways of Seeing, by John Berger\015\012This course explores the inter-relationship between epistemology and ontology,\015\012between the things that we are aware of and how that shapes the way in which we\015\012conceive our world. We will look at a series of iconic objects, including paintings,\015\012sculptures, music and films, to unravel the skeins of cultural assumptions that\015\012accompany the reception of well-known objects from the moment of their\015\012creation and through the history of their lives. We will observe through formal\015\012analysis, examine through multiple narratives that form the discourse around such\015\012objects, especially through changing times and contexts, and analyze the themes of\015\012representation and intention that journey alongside, for a more nuanced way of\015\012looking.\015\012Bibliography:\015\0121.
